In this repo I will share tips, groups and configuration settings that will help you start with TSM. Thanks for stopping by.

[TSM](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com) is an addon designed to help both casual gold makers as well as experienced goblins streamline their gold-making processes. TSM's features include everything from improving the native crafting and auctioning experiences to helping you gather needed materials and sniping that low-hanging auction house fruit!
